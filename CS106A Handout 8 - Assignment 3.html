<h1 id="assignment-3-lists-and-images">Assignment #3: Lists and Images</h1>

<p><strong>Due: 12:15pm (Pacific Time) on Monday, April 25th</strong></p>

<p><em><sup>Based on problems by Nick Bowman, Sonja Johnson-Yu, Kylie Jue, Nick
Parlante, Eric Roberts, and the current CS106A staff.</sup></em></p>

<p>This assignment consists of two sets of programs to give you practice
with lists and images, respectively, in Python. You can download the
starter code for this project under the "Assignments" tab on the CS106A
website. The starter project will provide Python files for you to write
your programs in.</p>

<p>The assignment is broken up into two parts. The first part of the
assignment focuses on writing a function and a program using lists,
which you can get started on now. In the second part of the assignment,
you'll get the chance to do some image manipulation, including a
sandcastle (warm-up) problem as well as two longer programs to write.
We'll cover images in class on Monday, April 18th, so you can do the
second part of the assignment after that.</p>

<p>The handout for this assignment is on the longer side, but don't be
intimidated by its length! It is long because it's designed to give you
step-by-step instructions for implementing several cool algorithms and
also considering their ethical implications!</p>

<h2 id="ethics-in-computing">Ethics in Computing</h2>

<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of the quarter, being a computer
scientist entails more than just writing code. The Association for
Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics
(<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics</a>) begins, "Computing
professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they
should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently
supporting the public good." Starting with this assignment (the portion
on image manipulation), you will put your ethical thinking skills to use
by reflecting on the potential impacts of your work and how they align
with your values. The programming fundamentals that you are mastering
give you the ability to create powerful, expressive, and impressive
applications ‚Äì just remember that with great power comes great
responsibility!</p>

<h2 id="part-1-lists">Part 1: Lists</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"Sandcastle" (warm-up) problem</strong>
You should write a function called <strong>greater_than</strong> (in the file <strong>greater_than.py</strong>) that is passed a threshold integer value and a list of integers, and returns a <em>new</em> list which contains only the numbers <em>strictly greater</em> than the threshold value from the original list passed in. For example, if your function was called as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>greater_than(6, [20, 6, 12, -3, 14])</strong></p>

    <p>then it should return the new list:</p>

    <p><strong>[20, 12, 14]</strong></p>

    <p>Note that the 6 in the original list is <strong>not</strong> included in the result
list since it is not strictly greater than the threshold value, which is 6.</p>

    <p>If your function is called with the empty list (or a list that does not contain any values greater than the threshold value), as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>greater_than(0, [])</strong></p>

    <p>then it should return a new empty list:</p>

    <p><strong>[]</strong></p>

    <p>Doctests are provided for you to test your function. Feel free to write additional doctests if you would like practice with that aspect of Python. Tests for your function are also provided in the <strong>main</strong> function included in the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reading values into a list and removing duplicates</strong></p>

    <p>In the file <strong>removeduplicates.py</strong> you should implement two functions. The first, called <strong>read_list()</strong>, asks the user for a series of integers until the user enters 0 to stop. The integers entered by the user (not including the final 0) should be stored in a list that the function should then <em>return</em>. Here is a sample run of the user entering values (user's inputs are in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>) and what the function should return (internally) in the program:</p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>5</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>3</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>6</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>2</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>7</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>6</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>3</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>3</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Enter value (0 to stop): <em>0</em></strong></p>

    <p>If the user entered the values above, the function should return the list:</p>

    <p><strong>[5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 6, 3, 3]</strong></p>

    <p>The second function you should write (also in the file
<strong>removeduplicates.py</strong>) is called <strong>remove_duplicates(num_list)</strong>. This
function is passed a list of integers (<strong>num_list</strong>) and it should
create and return a <em>new</em> list which does not include any
duplicate values from the original list passed in. The original list
passed into the function (<strong>num_list</strong>) should not be changed. For
example, calling:</p>

    <p><strong>remove_duplicates([5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 6, 3, 3])</strong></p>

    <p>should return the following new list:</p>

    <p><strong>[5, 3, 6, 2, 7]</strong></p>

    <p>If your function is called with the empty list, as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>remove_duplicates([])</strong></p>

    <p>then it should return a new empty list:</p>

    <p><strong>[]</strong></p>

    <p>Doctests are provided for you to test your <strong>remove_duplicates</strong>
function. Feel free to write additional doctests if you would like
practice with that aspect of Python.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-2-images">Part 2: Images</h2>

<h3 id="setup-installing-pillow">Setup: Installing Pillow</h3>

<p>Before you get started on Part 2 of the assignment, make sure that you
have run through the Pillow installation instructions, which can be
found in the "Image Reference" handout on the CS106A website. If you
cannot get Pillow installed successfully, please come to LaIR or post on
Ed for help.</p>

<h3 id="ethics-questions">Ethics Questions</h3>

<p>After completing certain components of Part 2 of this assignment, we
will ask you to reflect on the ethical issues raised by the code you
have just written by answering a couple of free-response questions. In
most cases, the ethical context for the questions will have been touched
upon during class (for images, that will be in the lecture on April
20th), but sometimes we may present a brief description of new contexts
as well. We do not believe that there is one right answer to these
questions. All we ask is that you think critically and <em>answer the
question to the best of your ability in a short paragraph (2-4
sentences)</em> in the text file <strong>ethics.txt</strong> provided in the Assignment 3
folder.</p>

<p>Reasoning about these questions will help you to understand and evaluate
the impact of the computer programs you write and instill you with
skills that you'll use throughout the rest of your journey as a
computer scientist. We encourage you to discuss these questions and the
issues they raise with your section leaders at IGs, with your fellow
students, and with the Embedded EthiCS Fellow, Katie Creel.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-to-do">Part 2 To Do</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"Sandcastle" (warm-up) problem: Finding forest fires.</strong></p>

    <p>We're going to start by writing a function called <strong>highlight_fires</strong>
(in the file <strong>forestfile.py</strong>) that highlights the areas where a forest
fire is active. You're given a satellite image of Greenland's 2017 fires
(photo credit: Stef Lhermitte, Delft University of Technology). Your job
is to detect all of the "sufficiently red" pixels in the image, which
are indicative of where fires are burning in the image. As we did in
class with the "redscreening" example, we consider a pixel "sufficiently
red" if its red value is greater than or equal to the average of the
pixel's three RGB values times some intensity threshold. In this case,
we have provided you with an appropriate intensity threshold of 1.05 via
a constant named <strong>INTENSITY_THRESHOLD</strong> in the file <strong>forestfire.py</strong>.
Note that this is a different intensity threshold value than we used in
class for the "redscreening" example, as different applications often
require different intensity threshold.</p>

    <p>When you detect a "sufficiently red" pixel in the original image, you
set its red value to 255 and its green and blue values to 0. This will
highlight the pixel by making it entirely red. For all other pixels
(i.e., those that are not "sufficiently red"), you should convert them
to their grayscale equivalent, so that we can more easily see where the
fire is originating from. You can grayscale a pixel by summing together
its red, green, and blue values and dividing by three (finding the
average), and then setting the pixel's red, green, and blue values to
all have this same "average" value. Once you highlight the areas that
are on fire in the image (and greyscale all the remaining pixels), you
should see an image like that shown on the right in Figure 1. On the
left side of Figure 1, we should the original image for comparison.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Original forest fire image on left, and highlighted
version of image on right.</p>

    <p>For a helpful reminder about the SimpleImage functions you have
available, you can use the Image Reference handout (available on the
CS106A webpage).</p>

    <p><strong>Ethics Question</strong></p>

    <p>In this exercise, you've used the power of computing to accomplish a
real-world task: recoloring satellite imagery to help humans understand
it. Your tool could make it easier for a human to identify which areas
of the forest are on fire. This could help firefighters to plan a fire
containment strategy or to decide which homes need to be evacuated.
You've used image manipulation to highlight and accentuate an existing
phenomenon, making it easier to comprehend via the naked eye. In the
process, you have reduced or eliminated other color information in the
image. This kind of visual idealization is common in science.
Astronomers use coloration schemes to display different types of
non-visual measurements and biologists use image processing tools to
accentuate potentially diseased areas of tissue.</p>

    <p>However, idealizations can also be dangerous. Their use relies heavily
on the assumptions built into their creation and the match between the
idealization and its purpose. Thinking back to the program you've
written and looking more closely at the output image, you can see that
the red highlighting of the fires is not perfect. Some areas that are on
fire are not highlighted and other areas that are highlighted are not
actually on fire. The consequences of this on a firefighter's plan of
attack for the fires or an evacuation administrator's evacuation plan
could be dire ‚Äì lives and homes could potentially be lost. Thus, we
want you to consider and answer the following questions (write your
answer in the file <strong>ethics.txt</strong>):</p>

    <p>a.  What is the programmer's responsibility in knowing the context of
    evaluation of an image processing algorithm/tool? How should this
    affect their decision-making process when implementing the
    algorithm/tool?</p>

    <p>b.  What information should you convey with your image in order to allow
    the viewer to evaluate its limitations? How would this change with
    the context of use?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Warhol Images</strong></p>

    <p>Your next task is to write a program that generates Andy Warhol-style
images that includes repeated variants of a starting image. The name of
the image file that you will be using for the starting image is
specified in the constant <strong>IMAGE_FILE</strong>, which is provided for you. To
tackle this task, we're going to break it down into a two primary
functions (although you are certainly welcome and encouraged to write
additional functions to decompose your program). You should implement
the following two functions in the order in which they are listed below.
Empty versions of these functions are provided in the file <strong>warhol.py</strong>
for you to fill in. As mentioned, you can add additional functions to
the <strong>warhol.py</strong> file as needed, but the functions specified below are
meant to be milestones in developing your program.</p>

    <p>a.  <strong>Task: Create a filter for a single image</strong></p>

    <p>Function: <strong>create_filtered_image(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale)</strong></p>

    <p>The first step is to create a function that can create filtered versions
of the starting image. The function is passed in floats (real values)
for <strong>red_scale</strong>, <strong>green_scale</strong>, and <strong>blue_scale</strong>. The function
should return an image object that is a copy of the image in the file
specified by the constant <strong>IMAGE_FILE</strong>, where the red, green, and blue
values for each pixel are respectively scaled by the parameters
<strong>red_scale</strong>, <strong>green_scale</strong>, and <strong>blue_scale</strong>. In order words, for
<strong>every</strong> pixel in the original image in the file
<strong>IMAGE_FILE</strong>, the corresponding pixel in the resulting filtered image
should have:</p>

    <p><strong>new red value = old red value * red_scale</strong></p>

    <p><strong>new green value = old green value * green_scale</strong></p>

    <p><strong>new blue value = old blue value * blue_scale</strong></p>

    <p>In the starter file we give you, the constant <strong>IMAGE_FILE</strong> is set to
<strong>'images/simba.jpg'</strong>, which is the name of an image file of Simba
the Dog:</p>

    <p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image3.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>If you were to call your function as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>create_filtered_image(1.5, 0.7, 1.5)</strong></p>

    <p>then your function should return a new image object that would look as
shown below if it was displayed:</p>

    <p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image4.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>Note that this function does <strong>not</strong> save an image file to disk and does
<strong>not</strong> modify the original file containing the image. This function
reads the image from the file into an <em>image object</em> (in memory when the
Python program is running) and all color changes are made to that image
object (in memory).</p>

    <p>b.  <strong>Task: Create a Warhol-style image</strong></p>

    <p>Function: <strong>make_warhol()</strong></p>

    <p>You should write a function <strong>make_warhol</strong> that returns an image
object, which has the image in the file specified by the constant
<strong>IMAGE_FILE</strong>, copied 6 times (in 2 rows and 3 columns), where each
patch (subimage) gets recolored using your <strong>create_filtered_image</strong>
function. An example resulting image is shown below:</p>

    <p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image5.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>You should select different <strong>red_scale</strong>, <strong>green_scale</strong>, and
<strong>blue_scale</strong> values for each of the patches, so they look distinct.
You don't need to try to match the colors in this example exactly. The
picture here is just an example. Experiment with different combinations
of <strong>red_scale</strong>, <strong>green_scale</strong>, and <strong>blue_scale</strong> values. For
example, the pink Simba in the first (upper left) patch in the image
above was generated by calling:</p>

    <p><strong>create_filtered_image(1.5, 0, 1.5)</strong></p>

    <p>The choice of the actual <strong>red_scale</strong>, <strong>green_scale</strong>, and
<strong>blue_scale</strong> values for each patch in your program are left up to you.
Be creative! This sort of image is inspired by some of Andy Warhol's
paintings, which is where the name for this function comes from.</p>

    <p>As before, this function does <strong>not</strong> save an image file to disk and
does <strong>not</strong> modify the original file containing the image. This
function reads the image from the file into an <em>image object</em> (in memory
when the Python program is running) and generates a new image object (in
memory) that contains the different colored patches.</p>

    <p>Hint: Your <strong>make_warhol</strong> function will need to start by creating a new
blank image object (using the function <strong>SimpleImage.blank</strong>) in order
to then copy individual patches into. In order to do that, you will
first need to determine the width and height of the original image so
you can determine how large the new blank image you are going to create
should be.</p>

    <p><strong>Writing the program</strong></p>

    <p>There is a <strong>main</strong> function provided in the starter code which simply
calls your <strong>make_warhol</strong> function and displays the resulting image
returned from your function.</p>

    <p>To help you write and debug the function <strong>create_filtered_image</strong>
<em>before</em> you write your <strong>make_warhol</strong> function, the
starter code also contains a call to the <strong>create_filtered_image</strong>
function, and displays the image returned from that function. The code
that calls <strong>create_filtered_image</strong> and displays the resulting image is
just provided for debugging purposes so you can complete the first task
in this problem (creating a single image filter) before moving to create
full Warhol images. You can delete the code in the <strong>main</strong> function
that calls <strong>create_filtered_image</strong> and displays the results when you
think you have the filter for single images working, and then just make
use of the call to the <strong>make_warhol</strong> function to show the final result
of your program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ghost</strong></p>

    <p>In the final problem, we're going to use multiple images to create a
new image (with some "clutter" removed). Suppose we are trying to take
pictures of Stanford, but each image has people walking through the
scene, as shown in Figure 2 below:</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Three images of Hoover Tower, with pedestrians walking in
the images.</p>

    <p>We'd like to analyze all these three images and figure out a way to
"ghost" out all the people and make them disappear, giving us a clear
view of Hoover tower, as shown in Figure 3. For this part of the
assignment, you will be writing a program called <strong>ghost.py</strong> that
implements this functionality. An algorithm for solving this problem is
explained below. <strong>Please also see the ethics question for this part of the assignment
below</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image9.png" alt=""></p>

    <p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: A sample output of your program in <strong>ghost.py</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ghost-algorithm-motivation">Ghost algorithm motivation</h3>

<p>Let's say that we have three images. From these images, consider the
three pixels that exist at coordinate <strong>(x, y)</strong> in each respective
image. Most of the time, these three pixels will look the same across
all three pictures, but in some cases, one of the pixels will look
different because there's a person at that location in that image. We'll
call pixels where there is a person "outlier" pixels, because they are
different from all the other pixels that exist at that that same <strong>(x,
y)</strong> location in the other photos. We'll assume that outlier pixels are
always in the minority ‚Äì that is, there will always be more "regular"
pixels than outliers.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the three pixels at location x = 100, y = 50 in
each of our three images look like this (we use the shorthand (<em>red</em>,
<em>green</em>, <em>blue</em>) to refer to the RGB values):</p>

<p>First photo: (1, 1, 1), Second photo: (1, 1, 1), Third photo: (28, 28,
28)</p>

<p>Looking at the pixels, you can guess that (28, 28, 28) is an outlier and
that (1, 1, 1) is the actual background since the RGB values (1, 1, 1)
appear the majority of the time among the pixels at location x=100,
y=50. In order to "ghost" out the person, we would throw out the (28,
28, 28) and use (1, 1, 1) as the RGB values for the pixel at location
x=100, y=50 in our final image. So, we need a way to algorithmically
distinguish outliers from background pixels. We explain that below.</p>

<h3 id="color-distance">Color Distance</h3>

<p>To solve this problem, it's handy to introduce the idea of "color
distance" between pixels. A distance metric can help us to quantify how
similar or dissimilar two colors are. This may initially seem like a
daunting task, until we recall that a color is comprised of a red value,
a green value, and a blue value. We can think of each pixel's color as a
point in a 3-dimensional color space, with red-green-blue coordinates
instead of the regular x-y-z coordinates.</p>

<p>Thinking in 2D: if we're trying to find the distance between two points
on a graph, we can use the distance formula (derived from the
Pythagorean Theorem) to find the distance between them:</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can apply this same principle to our 3D color space in order to
define a distance metric!</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In Python, we could write that distance function as:</p>

<p><strong>math.sqrt(red_difference ** 2 + green_difference ** 2 +
blue_difference ** 2)</strong></p>

<p>As a surprising optimization, we can <strong>omit</strong> the <strong>math.sqrt</strong> for this
algorithm (this will be explained further below).</p>

<h3 id="ghost-algorithm">Ghost algorithm</h3>

<p>Let's revisit our problem: for any particular <strong>(x, y)</strong> location in an
image, look at the pixels across all images at that same <strong>(x, y)</strong>
location. We want to pick out the "best" pixel to use while avoiding the
outlier pixels. The algorithm for doing this consists of two main parts:</p>

<p>a)  <strong>Compute the average RGB values</strong></p>

<p>For a given <strong>(x, y)</strong> location across all the images, average all the
red values to get the average red value, average all the green values to
get the average green value, and do the same for blue.</p>

<p>For example, consider a pixel at location (0, 5), which had the
following respective RGB values across three images:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Picture 1: (1, 1, 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Picture 2: (1, 1, 1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Picture 3: (28, 27, 29)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The average value for each color across the pixels would be as follows
(using <em>integer</em> division):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The average red value would be 10: (1 + 1 + 28) divided by 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average green value would be 9: (1 + 1 + 27) divided by 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average blue would be 10: (2 + 1 + 29) divided by 3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>b)  <strong>Select the best pixel</strong></p>

<p>To choose the best among the pixels, select the pixel with the
<strong><em>smallest</em></strong> color distance to the average red, green, and blue
values. Equivalently, we could say "the pixel closest to the average
RGB."</p>

<p>To think through the algorithm more generally, imagine the pixels
scattered in a 2D space of colors.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 8 - Assignment 3_files/08-image10.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: 2D mapping of true color, average of colors, and outlier
values.</p>

<p>All the pixels but the outlier will naturally cluster together,
grouped around the perfect color for that <strong>(x, y)</strong>, but displaced by
little measurement errors. The outlier pixel will be off by itself, a
completely different color. The average will fall somewhere in
between, but nearer to, the cluster, since the cluster has many pixels
and the outlier is just one pixel.</p>

<p>As a result, selecting the pixel closest to the average will give you
a pixel in the cluster of true color pixels.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to select the closest pixel, we can omit the
<strong>math.sqrt</strong> in our color distance calculations. The pixel we choose
has the smallest distance from the average pixel, and but due to the
nature of squaring numbers, the pixel will also have the smallest
squared color distance from the average pixel. In other words,
comparing distance versus squared distance does not change the pixel
we end up choosing. Therefore, we can leave out <strong>math.sqrt</strong> and use
distance squared instead of distance to find the best pixel (this is
actually a common technique when dealing with large amounts of data!).</p>

<h3 id="ghost-code">Ghost code</h3>

<p>To complete the tasks described above, you should implement the
following three functions in the order in which they are listed below.
Empty versions of these functions are provided in the file <strong>ghost.py</strong>
for you to fill in. Of course, you can add additional functions to the
<strong>ghost.py</strong> file as needed, but the functions specified below are meant
to be milestones in developing your program.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Because we are using Pixel objects, which can be difficult to
create and test with, we have written the doctests for you for these
functions. Our tests are not comprehensive, but should provide some
simple checks. You are certainly welcome (and encouraged) to write your
own doctests as well. This will give you a chance to get practice with
Python's very useful doctest feature.</p>

<p>a)  <strong>Task: Calculating squared pixel distance</strong></p>

<p>Function: <strong>get_pixel_dist(pixel, red, green, blue)</strong></p>

<p>Write the code for the <strong>get_pixel_dist</strong> function, which returns the
squared-distance between a pixel and a given red, green, and blue
value.</p>

<p>b)  <strong>Task: Find the best pixel</strong></p>

<p>Function: <strong>get_best_pixel(pixel_list)</strong></p>

<p>Write the code for the <strong>get_best_pixel</strong> function, which is given a
list of Pixel objects and returns the best Pixel from that list
according to the Ghost algorithm. As a reminder, the "best" pixel is
defined as the pixel that is closest to the "average" pixel. For
example, if the <strong>get_best_pixel</strong> function is called on a list
containing three Pixels with the following RBG values: (1, 1, 2), (1,
1, 1), and (28, 27, 29), it should return the Pixel which has RGB
values (1, 1, 2).</p>

<p>If multiple pixels qualify as the best, <strong>get_best_pixel</strong> can return
any of the closest pixels. You can assume <strong>pixel_list</strong> will never be
empty.</p>

<p>c)  <strong>Task: Create a ghost image</strong></p>

<p>Function: <strong>create_ghost(image_list)</strong></p>

<p>This is the function that solves the whole problem and should make use
of the other functions you wrote to solve sub-tasks. The <strong>main</strong>
function we provide for you, which you should not modify<strong>,</strong> does the
housekeeping of loading the image objects, and then calls
<strong>create_ghost</strong> to do the real work. It will then display the image
returned by your <strong>create_ghost</strong> function. You can assume that all
the images in the list of images passed into this function are the
same size (have the same height and width) and that the list of images
is never empty. Remember that your function should create a new
(blank) image of the same size as the images passed into the function
and the appropriately set the pixels in this new image to create the
"ghost" effect.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Decomposition</strong></p>

<p>If you decide to define helper functions while completing the above
functions, you should write function header comments explaining what
these helper functions do. However, doctests are not required.</p>

<p><strong>How to run your code</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>ghost.py</strong> program takes one "command line" argument, which is the
name of the folder that contains the image files you would like to run
the Ghost algorithm on. A command line argument is just something that
you type on the terminal command line after the name of the program you
want to run. For example, to run the <strong>ghost.py</strong> program using the
images in the "hoover" directory, you would type:</p>

<p>On the PC: <strong>py ghost.py hoover</strong></p>

<p>On the Mac: <strong>python3 ghost.py hoover</strong></p>

<p>Running the program on the "hoover" files from the Terminal like this
will print out the names of the images from that directory that your
program is being run on. It should (after you write your solution), then
display the image returned by your <strong>create_ghost</strong> function. For
example, the output on the terminal would like:</p>

<p><strong>&gt; py ghost.py hoover</strong></p>

<p><strong>Loading hoover\156-500.jpg</strong></p>

<p><strong>Loading hoover\158-500.jpg</strong></p>

<p><strong>Loading hoover\200-500.jpg</strong></p>

<p><strong>Displaying image!</strong></p>

<p>(then solution image appears)</p>

<p><strong>Additional test cases</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the <strong>hoover</strong> directory, we have provided image of other
places on the Stanford where you can apply the ghost program! Each set
of pictures is in its own folder, which are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>clock-tower</strong></p>

  <p><strong>math-corner</strong></p>

  <p><strong>monster</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at the individual images inside each folder to get a feel for the
data. Your code should work for all of these image folders. To try the
different places, you can run the following commands in a Terminal (use
"python3" instead of "py" if you are on a Mac).</p>

<p>Clock Tower ‚Äì a medium-sized case (Takes a few seconds to run)</p>

<p><strong>py ghost.py clock-tower</strong></p>

<p>Math Corner ‚Äì a large-sized case (Takes a few seconds to run)</p>

<p><strong>py ghost.py math-corner</strong></p>

<p>Monster ‚Äì an extra-large-sized case (Can take a few minutes to run, so
be patient)</p>

<p><strong>py ghost.py monster</strong></p>

<p>Note that in some of the resulting images, you might see some
"ghost-like" artifacts of people/bicycles that have been removed from
the original images. This is normal (though you might want to think
about why it happens).</p>

<p><strong>Ethics Question</strong></p>

<p>In this part of the assignment, you've implemented a clever algorithm
that eliminates transient passings of people in many partial images to
build a single image of Stanford's campus as empty. Your Ghost algorithm
performs an "idealization," removing components that are deemed to be
impediments to the presentation of the desired version of the image.
Taking this into consideration, we want you to consider and answer the
following questions (write your answer in the file <strong>ethics.txt</strong>):</p>

<p>a.  For what purposes might the final image produced by your Ghost
    algorithm, or other empty images of other parts of the world, be
    used? Who might want to create such an idealization?</p>

<p>b.  In class (on April 20th), we defined manipulation as hidden
    influence that subverts another's decision-making powers. Of the
    purposes you listed in (a), which ones involve <em>manipulation</em> and
    why?</p>
