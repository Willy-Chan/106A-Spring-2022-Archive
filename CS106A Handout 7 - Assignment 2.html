<h1 id="assignment-2-khan-sole-academy-and-computing-interest">Assignment #2: Khan-sole Academy and Computing Interest</h1>

<p><strong>Due: 12:15pm (Pacific Time) on Friday, April 15th</strong></p>

<p><em><sup>Based on problems by Jerry Cain, Eric Roberts, Nick Bowman, Sonja
Johnson-Yu, Kylie Jue, Chris Piech and current CS106A staff.</sup></em></p>

<p>This assignment consists of multiple short problems to give you practice
with several different concepts in Python (e.g., variables, control
structures, etc.) as well as two longer programs. You can download the
starter code for this project under the "Assignments" tab on the CS106A
website. The starter project will provide Python files for you to write
your programs in.</p>

<p>The assignment is broken up into two parts. The first part of the
assignment will give you practice writing short programs (we call them
"sandcastles"). In the second part of the assignment, you'll get the
chance to create two larger programs. In the spirit of learning how to
code, in this assignment we're going to use code to help others learn!
The second part of this assignment includes a mini version of
Khan(-sole) Academy as well as a program to show users how to compute
interest in a bank account.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-sandcastles">Part 1: Sandcastles</h2>

<p>"Sandcastle" problems are meant to be fairly straightforward and make
sure you're solid on particular concepts (like control flow, variables,
and functions) before moving on to writing larger programs. They're kind
of like building sandcastles in a sandbox ‚Äì they're meant to be fun to
do and no one gets hurt. Please make sure you do these six problems
before moving on to other parts of the assignment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For this problem, you will be tracing some code (below) by hand.
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Please try doing this by hand rather than plugging it into
PyCharm.</strong> What is printed to the console when the following
function call is made? Put your answer in the file <strong>trace.txt</strong>
provided in the Assignment 2 folder.</p>

    <p>Write a program in the file <strong>subtract_numbers.py</strong> that reads two
<strong><em>real numbers</em></strong> from the user and prints the first number minus
the second number. You can assume the user will always enter valid
real numbers as input (negative values are fine). Yes, we know this
problem is really similar to a problem we did in class ‚Äì that's why
this problem is a sandcastle! A sample run of the program is shown
below (user input is in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>This program subtracts one number from another.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Enter first number: <em>5.5</em></strong></p>

    <p>Write a program in the file <strong>random_numbers.py</strong> that prints 10
random integers (each random integer should have a value between 0
and 100, inclusive). Your program should use a constant named
<strong>NUM_RANDOM</strong> (with a value of 10), which determines the number of
random numbers to print. Your program should also use constants
named <strong>MIN_RANDOM</strong> and <strong>MAX_RANDOM</strong> to determine the minimal and
maximal values of the random numbers generated (with respective
values 0 and 100). To generate random numbers, you should use the
function <strong>random.randint()</strong> from Python's <strong>random</strong> library
(which we discussed in class). A sample run of the program is shown
below.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>35</strong></p>

    <p>Humans first landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. (No, the moon
landing was not faked.) People have often wondered how much they
would weigh if they were on the moon. It turns out that on the moon,
you would weigh 16.5% of your weight on Earth. Write a program
<strong>moon_weight.py</strong> that asks the user for their weight (you can
assume a real-valued input is given by the user) and prints out
their weight on the moon. If the user enters a negative value (yes,
they're being mean and trying to break your program), you should
just print out that weights can't be negative. Remember when writing
your solution, that it's good programming style to use
<strong>constants</strong> where appropriate. Two sample runs of the
program are shown below (user input is in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>).</p>

    <p>Sample run 1 (note the imprecision of floating-point numbers in the
answer)</p>

    <p><strong>Enter your weight: <em>165.3</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your weight on the moon is 27.274500000000003</strong></p>

    <p>Sample run 2</p>

    <p><strong>Enter your weight: <em>-13</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Sorry, you can't have a negative weight.</strong></p>

    <p>In geometry, you learned the Pythagorean theorem for the

    <p>which can alternatively be written as:</p>

    <p><img src="./CS106A Handout 7 - Assignment 2_files/07-image2.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>Write a program in the file <strong>pythagorean.py</strong> that gets two values for <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> as floats (you can assume that <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> will be positive real values) from the user and then calculates the solution of <strong>c</strong> and prints it. Recall that to compute square roots, you can use the function <strong>math.sqrt()</strong> from Python's <strong>math</strong> library (which we discussed in class). A sample run of the program is shown below (user input is in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>):</p>

    <p><strong>Enter values to compute the Pythagorean theorem.</strong></p>

    <p>a: <em>9.7</em></p>

    <p><strong>Khan-sole Academy</strong></p>

    <p>Now that you've seen how programming can help us in a number of
different areas, it's time for you to implement Khan-sole Academy‚Äîa
program that helps other people learn! In this problem, you'll write a
program in the file <strong>khansole_academy.py</strong> that randomly generates
simple addition problems for the user, reads in the answer from the
user, and then checks to see if they got it right or wrong, until the
user appears to have mastered the material.</p>

    <p>More specifically, your program should be able to generate simple
addition problems that involve adding two 2-digit integers (i.e., the
numbers 10 through 99). The user should be asked for an answer to each
problem. Your program should determine if the answer was correct or not,
and give the user an appropriate message to let them know. Your program
should keep giving the user problems until the user has gotten 3
problems <strong>correct in a row</strong>. (Note: the number of
problems the user needs to get correctly in a row to complete the
program is just one example of a good place to specify a constant in
your program).</p>

    <p>A sample run of the program is shown below (user input is in
<strong><em>italics</em></strong>).</p>

    <p><strong>What is 51 + 79?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>120</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Incorrect. The expected answer is 130</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 33 + 19?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>42</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Incorrect. The expected answer is 52</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 55 + 11?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>66</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Correct! You've gotten 1 correct in a row.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 84 + 25?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>109</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Correct! You've gotten 2 correct in a row.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 26 + 58?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: 74</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Incorrect. The expected answer is 84</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 98 + 85?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>183</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Correct! You've gotten 1 correct in a row.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 79 + 66?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>145</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Correct! You've gotten 2 correct in a row.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is 97 + 20?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Your answer: <em>117</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Correct! You've gotten 3 correct in a row.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Congratulations! You mastered addition.</strong></p>

    <p>As a side note, one of the earliest programs Mehran wrote (with his
friend Matthew) when he was first learning how to program was very
similar to Khansole Academy. It was called "M&amp;M's Math Puzzles." It was
written in a language named BASIC on a computer that had 4K of memory
(that's 4 Kilobytes) and used cassette tapes (the same kind used for
music in the 1970's) to store information. Yeah, Mehran is old.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computing Interest</strong></p>

    <p>We want to write a program <strong>compute_interest.py</strong> that helps a user
compute how much interest their bank account will accrue over time. The
program starts by asking the user for an initial account balance, which
is entered as a float (you can assume a positive real-value is entered).
The program then asks the user for a starting year and month as well as
an ending year and month, all entered as integers. The program then asks
the user for a monthly interest rate. For example, a 2% interest rate
would be entered by the user as the value 0.02.</p>

    <p>The program should print out the monthly balance in the account from the
starting year/month up to and including the ending year/month with
<strong>interest accruing monthly</strong>. The amount of interest earned
each month is simply the amount in the account in that month multiplied
by the interest rate entered by the user. So (using a 2% interest rate)
an account with $1000.00 at the start of the month would earn $20.00
that month and have a total of $1020.00 at the start of the next month.</p>

    <p>After printing the monthly balance projection, your program should then
repeat the process of asking the user for a new interest rate and
printing the monthly balance in the account using the same starting
account balance, starting year/month, and ending year/month as the user
<em>initially</em> entered in the program. The program should end
if the user specifies a monthly interest rate of 0%.</p>

    <p>You can assume that the user will always enter a valid (i.e., positive)
value for the start/end year and an integer from 1 to 12 for the
start/end month. If the starting year/month is the <em>same as or
after</em> the ending year/month, your program should not ask
for an interest rate, but rather simply print "Starting date needs to be
before the ending date." and then end without an error.</p>

    <p>The values for the initial balance, the starting year/month, and the
ending year/month are entered by the user. The monthly balance is simply
printed as a float, so you don't have to worry about rounding to the
nearest cent.</p>

    <p>Remember that it's a good idea to decompose your program and use
parameters with functions as needed to pass information around your
program. That's really part of good programming style.</p>

    <p>Two sample runs of the program are shown below (user input is in
<strong><em>italics</em></strong>).</p>

    <p><strong>Sample run 1</strong> (showing what happens if the user enters a starts
year/month that is <em>after</em> the ending year/month. Note the program
simply ends without asking for an interest rate.)</p>

    <p><strong>Initial balance: <em>500.00</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Start year: <em>2020</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Start month: <em>9</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>End year: <em>2019</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>End month: <em>10</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Starting date needs to be before the ending date.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Sample run 2</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Initial balance: <em>1000.00</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>Start year: <em>2022</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="possible-extensions">Possible Extensions</h2>

<p>Once you've completed all the required parts of the assignment, you
might want to consider adding some extensions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Extend Khansole Academy</p>

    <p>You could consider extending your Khansole Academy program to, for
 example, add more problem types (subtraction, multiplication, division,
 and more). You could also consider problems beyond arithmetic. If you
 could build your own version of Khansole Academy, what would you use it
 to help people learn? Be creative and enjoy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hailstones</p>

    <p>A separate (optional) problem you could consider writing is based on a
 problem in Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book <em>G√∂del,
 Escher, Bach</em>. That book contains many interesting
 mathematical puzzles, many of which can be expressed in the form of
 computer programs. In Chapter XII, Hofstadter mentions a wonderful
 problem that is well within the scope of what you know. The problem can
 be expressed as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Pick some positive integer and call it <em>n</em>.</p>

      <p>If <em>n</em> is even, divide it by two.</p>

      <p>If <em>n</em> is odd, multiply it by three and add one.</p>

      <p>Continue this process until <em>n</em> is equal to one.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On page 401 of the Vintage edition of his book, Hofstadter illustrates
 this process with thfollowing example, starting with the number 15:</p>

    <p>15 is odd, so I make 3<em>n</em>+1: 46</p>

    <p>46 is even, so I take half: 23</p>

    <p>23 is odd, so I make 3<em>n</em>+1: 70</p>

    <p>70 is even, so I take half: 35</p>

    <p>35 is odd, so I make 3<em>n</em>+1: 106</p>

    <p>106 is even, so I take half: 53</p>

    <p>53 is odd, so I make 3<em>n</em>+1: 160</p>

    <p>160 is even, so I take half: 80</p>

    <p>80 is even, so I take half: 40</p>

    <p>40 is even, so I take half: 20</p>

    <p>20 is even, so I take half: 10</p>

    <p>10 is even, so I take half: 5</p>

    <p>5 is odd, so I make 3<em>n</em>+1: 16</p>

    <p>16 is even, so I take half: 8</p>

    <p>8 is even, so I take half: 4</p>

    <p>4 is even, so I take half: 2</p>

    <p>2 is even, so I take half: 1</p>

    <p>As you can see from this example, the numbers go up and down, but
 eventually‚Äîat least for all numbers that have ever been tried‚Äîcomes
 down to end in 1. In some respects, this process is reminiscent of the
 formation of hailstones, which get carried upward by the winds over and
 over again before they finally descend to the ground. Because of this
 analogy, this sequence of numbers is usually called the <strong>Hailstone
 sequence,</strong> although it goes by many other names as well.</p>

    <p>You might want to write a Python program that reads in a number from the
 user and then displays the Hailstone sequence for that number, just as
 in Hofstadter's book, followed by a line showing the number of steps
 taken to reach 1. For example, here's a sample run of what such a
 program might look like (user input is in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>):</p>

    <p><strong>Enter a number: <em>17</em></strong></p>

    <p><strong>17 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 52</strong></p>

    <p><strong>52 is even, so I take half: 26</strong></p>

    <p><strong>26 is even, so I take half: 13</strong></p>

    <p><strong>13 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 40</strong></p>

    <p><strong>40 is even, so I take half: 20</strong></p>

    <p><strong>20 is even, so I take half: 10</strong></p>

    <p><strong>10 is even, so I take half: 5</strong></p>

    <p><strong>5 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 16</strong></p>

    <p><strong>16 is even, so I take half: 8</strong></p>

    <p><strong>8 is even, so I take half: 4</strong></p>

    <p><strong>4 is even, so I take half: 2</strong></p>

    <p><strong>2 is even, so I take half: 1</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The process took 12 steps to reach 1</strong></p>
