<h1 id="assignment-5-strings-and-word-guessing">Assignment #5: Strings and Word Guessing</h1>

<p><strong>Due: 12:15pm (Pacific Time) on Monday, May 16th</strong></p>

<p><em><sup>Based on problems by Eric Roberts, Nick Parlante, and the current
CS106A staff.</sup></em></p>

<p>This assignment will give you the opportunity to get lots of practice
using files and strings as well as start to work with dictionaries
(you'll get a lot more practice with dictionaries on assignments 6 and
7 as well). You can download the starter code for this project under the
"Assignments" tab on the CS106A website. The starter project will
provide Python files for you to write your programs in.</p>

<p>The assignment is broken up into three parts. The first part of the
assignment focuses on a smaller sandcastle problem to give you practice
writing a program with strings, files, and dictionaries. The second part
of the assignment is a longer program that uses strings to play a word
guessing game (similar to the game Hangman, if you're familiar with
that game). This is a complex task, but armed with the skills you've
been honing, especially using decomposition, you'll sail through. The
third and final part of the assignment has you answer a short reflective
ethics question.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-sandcastle--totaling-credit-card-bill-by-store">Part 1: Sandcastle ‚Äì Totaling credit card bill by store</h2>

<p>Realizing that keeping track of credit card expenses is a particularly
good use of your computer science skills, you decide to write a program
that helps you track how much money you are spending at each store in a
given month. Your program should read a data file (given by the constant
named <strong>INPUT_FILE</strong>), which contains your credit card bill for a given
month. Each line of the credit card bill represents one transaction.
Each line starts with the date of the purchase, followed by a space,
then the name of the store enclosed in square brackets, like so:
<strong>[<em>name</em>]</strong> (you can assume no store names contain square bracket
characters and store names also do not include the dollar sign (<strong>$</strong>)
character), followed by a space, and then a dollar sign, and then the
amount of the purchase (as an integer, since we assume here that
transactions are just rounded to a whole dollar amount). A sample data
file (<strong>bill1.txt</strong>) representing a credit card bill looks as follows:</p>

<p><strong>File: bill1.txt</strong></p>
<pre>9/2/19 [Target] $12
9/21/19 [Stanford Bookstore] $102
9/30/19 [Jamba Juice] $5
10/7/19 [Target] $17
10/22/19 [Jamba Juice] $8
10/28/19 [Target] $45
</pre>

<p>In the file <strong>credit_card_total.py</strong>, you should write a program reads
such a credit card bill file and prints to the screen the <strong><em>total</em></strong>
amount that was purchased at <strong><em>each</em></strong> store on the bill. For example,
given the input file <strong>bill1.txt</strong> (above), your program should print
the output:</p>

<pre>Target: $74
Stanford Bookstore: $102
Jamba Juice: $13
</pre>

<p>The output printed by your program should match the sample output as
closely as possible, but you don't need to worry about the order in
which the stores are printed. You can assume that the input file is
properly formatted (as described above). Two sample input files
(<strong>bill1.txt</strong> and <strong>bill2.txt</strong>) are provided in the assignment project
folder to help you test your program. The output of your program using
the file <strong>bill2.txt</strong> as input should be (again, you don't need to
worry about the ordering of the stores in the output):</p>

<pre>Shake Shack: $16
Grocery Hut: $293
Ace Hardware: $14
Joan's Fabric: $18
Nom Nom Nom: $12
</pre>

<p>Hint: using dictionaries would be a really good way to solve this
problem!</p>

<h2 id="part-2-word-guessing">Part 2: Word Guessing</h2>

<p>For the second part of this assignment, your mission is to write a
program that plays a word guessing game. This game is also some times
called "Hangman", but we'll just call it "WordGuess" here. The
WordGuess program is designed to give you some practice working with
strings and files.</p>

<p><strong>The WordGuess game</strong></p>

<p>When the user plays WordGuess, the computer first selects a secret word
at random from a list built into the program. The program then prints
out a row of dashes‚Äîone for each letter in the secret word and asks
the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the
word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in
the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on
previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is
charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until
either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or
(2) the user has made eight incorrect guesses. Two sample runs of the
game are shown below (user input is shown in <strong><em>italics</em></strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Sample Run 1:</strong></p>

<pre>The word now looks like this: -----
You have 8 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>a</i>
That guess is correct.
The word now looks like this: -A---
You have 8 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>q</i>
There are no Q's in the word
The word now looks like this: -A---
You have 7 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>p</i>
That guess is correct.
The word now looks like this: -APP-
You have 7 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>C</i>
There are no C's in the word
The word now looks like this: -APP-
You have 6 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>H</i>
That guess is correct.
The word now looks like this: HAPP-
You have 6 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>y</i>
That guess is correct.
Congratulations, the word is: HAPPY
</pre>

There are no L's in the word
The word now looks like this: P--H--
You have 2 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>E</i>
There are no E's in the word
The word now looks like this: P--H--
You have 1 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: <i>r</i>
There are no R's in the word
Sorry, you lost. The secret word was: PYTHON
</pre>

<p>In order to write the program that plays WordGuess, you should design
and test your program in two parts. The first part consists of getting
the interactive part of the game working with a fixed set of secret
words (that are initially provided for you). The second part consists of
replacing the supplied version of the secret word list with one that
reads words from a file. The rest of this handout describes these two
parts in more detail.</p>

<p>Note that your program only needs to be able to play the WordGuess game
once through (i.e., the player guessing one word), but it should be
pretty easy to extend your program to allow the player to play multiple
rounds (i.e., guessing a word multiple times).</p>

<h3 id="wordguess-game-part-iplaying-the-game">WordGuess Game: Part I‚ÄîPlaying the game</h3>

<p>In the first part of this assignment, your job is to write a program
that handles the user interaction component of the game. To solve the
problem, your program must be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Choose a random word to use as the secret word. That word is chosen
from a word list, as described below. (An initial implementation of this
is provided for you.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep track of the user's partially guessed word, which begins as a
series of dashes and then gets updated as correct letters are guessed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-Implement the basic control structure and manage the details (ask the
user to guess a letter, keep track of the number of guesses remaining,
print out the various messages, detect the end of the game, and so
forth).</p>

<p>For this part of the assignment, you will simply make use of a function
that we've given you called <strong>get_word</strong> that returns a word (string)
randomly chosen from a small list of words that will allow you to test
your program. The initial code you are provided for the <strong>get_word</strong>
function is only a temporary expedient to make it possible to code this
part of the assignment. In Part II, you will reimplement the
<strong>get_word</strong> function we've provided with one that reads a list of words
from a data file in order to select the random word from a much larger
set of possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>The game</strong></p>

<p>The two sample runs shown previously should be sufficient to illustrate
the basic operation of the game, but the following points may help to
clarify a few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>main</strong> function, we call the <strong>get_word</strong> function to get a
secret word for the user to guess, store it in a variable named
<strong>secret_word</strong> and then pass that <strong>secret_word</strong> to a function called
<strong>play_game</strong>. For this part of the assignment, you should implement the
<strong>play_game</strong> function, along with any additional functions that are
needed to properly decompose the program, to produce a working game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should accept the user's guesses in <strong>either lower or upper
case</strong>, even though all letters in the secret words are written in
[upper]{.underline} case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the user guesses something that is more than a single character,
your program should tell the user that the guess should only be a single
letter and accept a new guess. It should [not]{.underline} count the
guess that was more than a single character as an incorrect guess.
Here's an example of what that interaction should look like (where the
user enters the guess <strong><em>AA</em></strong>). Notice that the user's guess did not
reduce the number of guesses they have remaining.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre>The word now looks like this: ------
You have 8 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter: AA
Guess should only be a single character.
The word now looks like this: ------
You have 8 guesses left
Type a single letter here, then press enter:
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the user guesses a correct letter more than once, your program
should do nothing (basically, it's just another correct guess, so the
number of guesses left is not reduced). Guessing an incorrect letter a
second time should be counted as another wrong guess. (In each case,
these interpretations are the easiest way to handle the situation, and
your program will probably do the right thing even if you don't think
about these cases in detail.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the user guesses a character, such as a period (<strong>.</strong>) or
exclamation point (<strong>!</strong>), that is not a letter (and therefore would not
be in the secret word), you can just count that as an incorrect guess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of guesses the player initially starts with is determined
by the constant <strong>INITIAL_GUESSES</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wordguess-game-part-iireading-a-word-list-from-a-file">WordGuess Game: Part II‚ÄîReading a word list from a file</h3>

<p>Part II is much easier than Part I and requires less than half a page of
code. Your job in this part of the assignment is simply to re-implement
the <strong>get_word</strong> function so that instead of being hard-coded to select
from a meager list of three words, it reads a much larger word list from
a file and returns a word from that list. The steps involved in this
part of the assignment are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Reimplement the <strong>get_word</strong> function so that it opens the file
specified by the constant <strong>LEXICON_FILE</strong> and reads it line by line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the lines from the file into a list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using that list of words, <em>randomly</em> return any word in the list
from the <strong>get_word</strong> function. You can feel free to define additional
helper functions if you need to, but it's likely that all the code you
need to implement this functionality will fit nicely in the <strong>get_word</strong>
function itself.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that nothing in the rest of the program should have to change in
response to this change in the implementation of <strong>get_word</strong>.
Insulating parts of a program from changes in other parts is a
fundamental principle of good software design. Thus, in your
implementation of the <strong>get_word</strong>, you should not be changing the
parameters of this function.</p>

<p>As a side note, the file <strong>Lexicon.txt</strong> contains a very large list of
words that can used to make the game more challenging to play, and the
final version of your program should use that file for input. But to
help you test this part of your program, we also provide a much smaller
word list in the file <strong>TestLexicon.txt</strong>. You can feel free to use the
<strong>TestLexicon.txt</strong> file to help you develop/debug your reimplementation
of the <strong>get_word</strong> function, but make sure the final version of your
program works properly with the full <strong>Lexicon.txt</strong> file.</p>

<p>Hint: remember to use the <strong>strip</strong> function when reading the file to
avoid any nasty complications arising from newline characters at the end
of lines.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Make sure your output matches that in
the sample runs as closely as possible.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-reflective-ethics-question">Part 3: Reflective Ethics Question:</h2>

<p>As discussed in class about character representations, Unicode still has
not fully overtaken ASCII as the "default" standard for string
representation in programming languages and computer systems. Suppose
you are a software engineer implementing a website form meant to gather
personal data such as names. Your boss expresses that your algorithm is
only expected to work for ASCII-encoded strings, since supporting
Unicode would require extra work and time. What would your response be?
What representational harms might result from building a system that
exclusively uses ASCII to represent strings?</p>

<p>We ask that you think critically and <em>answer the question above to the
best of your ability in a short paragraph</em> in the text file
<strong>ethics.txt</strong> provided in the Assignment 5 folder.</p>

<h2 id="extension-ideas">Extension ideas</h2>

<p>There are many ways to extend the WordGuess game to make it more fun if
you want. Of course, we encourage you to some up with your own ideas,
but here are a few possibilites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You could use graphics to spice up the display. For example, you could
use graphics to have this program emulate the game "Hangman" where a
person (stick figure) is displayed part by part with each incorrect
guess the user makes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You could expand the program to play something like Wheel of Fortune,
in which the single word is replaced by a common phrase and in which you
have to buy vowels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use your imagination!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work**</h2>

<p>Once you've gotten all the parts of this assignment working,
congratulations! You've now also got a fun game that you can play.</p>

<p>Make sure to submit <strong>all</strong> the python files for this
assignment on Paperless. You should make sure to submit the files:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">credit_card_total</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>

<span class="n">ethics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">txt</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, in the Assignment 5 project folder, we have provided a
file called <strong>extension.py</strong> that you can use if you want to write any
extensions that you might want to make based on this assignment. The
file doesn't contain any useful code to begin with. So, you only need
to submit the <strong>extension.py</strong> file if you've written some sort of
extension in that file that you'd like us to see.</p>
