        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-10" id="content" <=""><p>March 30th, 2022</p>

<p><strong>Due: 12:15pm (Pacific Time) on Friday, April 8th</strong></p>

<p><em><sup>Based on problems by Nick Parlante and Eric Roberts, lovingly modified
by your current CS106A staff.</sup></em></p>

<p>This assignment consists of four Karel programs. There is a starter
project including all of these problems on the CS106A website under the
"Assignments" tab. Before you start on this assignment, make sure to
read Handout #4 (Using Karel with PyCharm) in its entirety. When you are
ready to start working on these programs, you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download the starter project as described in Handout #4 (Using Karel
with PyCharm).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the Karel program files so that the assignment actually does
what it's supposed to do. This will involve a cycle of coding,
testing, and debugging until everything works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have gotten each part of the program to run correctly in
the default world associated with the problem, you should make sure
that your code runs properly in all of the worlds that we have
provided for a given problem. Instructions on how to load new worlds
for Karel to run in can be found in Handout #4 (Using Karel with
PyCharm).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment on Paperless as described in Handout #6
(Submitting Assignments), which will be distributed on Friday.
Remember that you can submit more than one version of your project,
but only the most recent submission will be graded. If you discover
an error after you've made a submission, just fix your program and
submit a new copy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The four Karel problems to solve are described on the following pages.</p>

<p><strong>Please remember that your Karel programs must limit themselves to the
language features described in the <a href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/intro.html">Karel the Robot Learns
Python</a>.
You may <u>not</u> use other features of Python (including
variables, parameters, break, and return), even though the PyCharm-based
version of Karel accepts them.</strong></p>

<h2 id="problem-1-collectnewspaperkarelpy">Problem 1 (CollectNewspaperKarel.py)</h2>

<p>Your first task is to solve a simple story-problem in Karel's world.
Suppose that Karel has settled into its house, which is the square area
in the center of Figure 1.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image1.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Karel's starting state for <strong>CollectNewspaperKarel</strong></p>

<p>Karel starts off in the northwest corner of its house as shown in the
diagram. The problem you need to solve is to get Karel to collect the
newspaper. The newspaper, like all objects in Karel's world, is
represented by a beeper. You must get Karel to pick up the newspaper
located outside the doorway and then to return to its initial position.</p>

<p>This exercise is simple and is meant to help you get you started
programming with Karel. You can assume that every part of the world
looks just as it does in the diagram: the house is exactly this size,
the door is always in the position shown, and the beeper is just outside
the door. Thus, all you have to do is write the sequence of commands
necessary to have Karel:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Move to the newspaper,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick it up, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to its starting point.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Although the program does not have many lines of code, it is still worth
getting some practice with decomposition. In your solution, include a
function for <em>each</em> of the three steps shown in the outline above.</p>

<p>Your program should run successfully in the following world:</p>

<p><strong>CollectNewspaperKarel.w</strong> (default world)</p>

<p>Note that all Karel worlds are located in the <strong>worlds</strong> folder in the
Assignment 1 project folder.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-stonemasonkarelpy">Problem 2 (StoneMasonKarel.py)</h2>

<p>Your next task is to repair the damage done to the Main Quad in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake</a>.
In particular, Karel should repair a set of arches where some of the
stones (represented by beepers, of course) are missing from the columns
supporting the arches, as illustrated in Figure 2 (below).</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image2.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An initial example world with broken arches that
<strong>StoneMasonKarel</strong> must repair</p>

<p>Your program should work on the world shown above, but it should be
general enough to handle [any world that meets the basic conditions
outlined at the end of this problem]{.underline}. There are several
example worlds in the starter folder, and your program should work
correctly in all of them.</p>

<p>When Karel is done, the missing stones in the columns should be replaced
by beepers, so that the final picture resulting from the initial world
shown in Figure 2 would look like the illustration in Figure 3 below.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image3.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Karel should repair the Main Quad to a structurally sound
state after completion.</p>

<p>Karel's final location and the final direction Karel is facing at the
end of the run do not matter.</p>

<p>Karel may count on the following facts about the world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Karel starts at the corner where 1st Avenue and 1st Street meet,
facing east, with an infinite number of beepers in Karel's beeper
bag. The first column should be built on 1st Avenue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The columns are always exactly four Avenues apart, so they would be
built on 1st Avenue, 5th Avenue, 9th Avenue, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final column will always have a wall immediately after it.
Although this wall appears after 13th Avenue in the example figure,
your program should work for any number of beeper columns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The top of a beeper column will always be marked by a wall. However,
Karel cannot assume that columns are always five units high, or even
that all columns within a given world are the same height.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an initial world, some columns may already contain beepers
representing stones that are still in place. Your program should not
put a second beeper on corners that already have beepers. Avenues
that will not have columns will never contain existing beepers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should make sure your program runs successfully in all of the
following worlds (which are just a few different examples to test out
the generality of your solution):</p>

<p><strong>StoneMasonKarel.w</strong> (default world), <strong>SampleQuad1.w</strong>,
<strong>SampleQuad2.w</strong></p>

<p>Note that all Karel worlds are located in the <strong>worlds</strong> folder in the
Assignment 1 project folder.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-checkerboardkarelpy">Problem 3 (CheckerboardKarel.py)</h2>

<p>Your third task is to get Karel to create a checkerboard pattern of
beepers inside an empty rectangular world, as illustrated in Figure 4.
(Karel's final location and the final direction it is facing at the end
of the run do not matter.)</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image4.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: The beginning and end states for <strong>CheckerboardKarel</strong>.</p>

<p>This problem has a nice decomposition structure along with some
interesting algorithmic issues. As you think about how you will solve
the problem, you should make sure that your solution works with
checkerboards that are different in size from the standard 8x8
checkerboard shown in the example above. Some examples of such cases are
discussed below.</p>

<p>Odd-sized checkerboards are tricky, and you should make sure that your
program generates the following pattern in a 5x3 world:</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image5.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure 5</strong>: Karel should generate this checkerboard pattern for a 5x3
world.</p>

<p>Other special cases you should consider are worlds with only a single
column or a single row. The starter code folder contains several sample
worlds with these special cases, and you should make sure that your
program works for each of them.</p>

<p>This problem is hard: Try simplifying your solution with decomposition.
Can you checker a single row/column? Make the row/column work for
different widths/heights? Once you've finished a single row/column, can
you make Karel fill two? Three? All of them? Incrementally developing
your program in stages helps break it down into simpler parts and is a
wise strategy for attacking hard programming problems.</p>

<p>You should make sure your program runs successfully in all of the
following worlds (which are just a few different examples to test out
the generality of your solution):</p>

<p><strong>CheckerboardKarel.w</strong> (default world), <strong>8x1.w</strong>, <strong>1x8.w</strong>,
<strong>7x7.w</strong>, <strong>6x5.w</strong>, <strong>3x5.w</strong>, <strong>40x40.w</strong>, <strong>1x1.w</strong></p>

<p>Note that all Karel worlds are located in the <strong>worlds</strong> folder in the
Assignment 1 project folder.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4-midpointkarelpy">Problem 4 (MidpointKarel.py)</h2>

<p>As an exercise in solving algorithmic problems, program Karel to place a
single beeper at the center of 1st Street. For example, say Karel starts
in the 5x5 world pictured in Figure 6.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image6.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The beginning state for <strong>MidpointKarel</strong></p>

<p>Karel should end with Karel standing on a beeper in the following
position (Figure 7):</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Handout 5 - Assignment 1 Karel the Robot_files/05-image7.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The end state for <strong>MidpointKarel</strong></p>

<p>Note that the final configuration of the world should have only a single
beeper at the midpoint of 1st Street. Along the way, Karel is allowed to
place additional beepers wherever it wants to, but must pick them all up
again before it finishes. Similarly, if Karel paints/colors any of the
corners in the world, they must all be uncolored before Karel finishes.</p>

<p>In solving this problem, you may count on the following facts about the
world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Karel starts at 1st Avenue and 1st Street, facing east, with an
infinite number of beepers in its bag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial state of the world includes no interior walls or
beepers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world need not be square, but you may assume that it is at least
as tall as it is wide.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your program, moreover, can assume the following simplifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the width of the world is odd, Karel must put the beeper in the
center square. If the width is even, Karel may drop the beeper on
either of the two center squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter which direction Karel is facing at the end of the
run.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many different algorithms you can use to solve this problem so
feel free to be creative!</p>

<p>You should make sure your program runs successfully in all of the
following worlds (which are just a few different examples to test out
the generality of your solution):</p>

<p><strong>MidpointKarel.w</strong> (default world)<strong>, Midpoint1.w, Midpoint2.w,
Midpoint8.w</strong></p>

<p>Note that all Karel worlds are located in the <strong>worlds</strong> folder in the
Assignment 1 project folder.</p>

<h2 id="possible-extensions-optional">Possible extensions (optional)</h2>

<h3 id="bonus-create-your-own-karel-project">Bonus: Create your own Karel project</h3>

<p>If you finish early, you may <strong><em>optionally</em></strong> write a Karel project of
your own choice. Modify <strong>ExtensionKarel.py</strong> to use Karel to complete
any task of your choosing. Extensions are a great chance for practice
and, if your extension is substantial enough, it might help you earn a
<strong>+</strong> score. Make sure to write comments to explain what your program is
doing and update <strong>ExtensionKarel.w</strong> to be an appropriate world for
your program.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Following the instructions in Handout #6 (Submitting Assignments), you
should submit the following files (do not include any files not included
in this list!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CollectNewspaperKarel.py</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>StoneMasonKarel.py</strong></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you did an optional extension on the assignment, you should also
submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ExtensionKarel.py</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advice-tips-and-tricks">Advice, Tips, and Tricks</h2>

<p>All of the Karel problems you will solve, except for
<strong>CollectNewspaperKarel</strong>, should be able to work in a variety of
different worlds that match the problem specifications. When you first
run your Karel programs, you will be presented with a sample world in
which you can get started writing and testing your solution. However, we
will test your solutions to each of the Karel programs, except for
<strong>CollectNewspaperKarel</strong>, in a variety of test worlds. Unfortunately,
each quarter, many students submit Karel programs that work brilliantly
in the default worlds but which fail catastrophically in some of the
other test worlds. Before you submit your Karel programs, <strong>[<em>be sure to
test them out in as many different worlds as you can</em>.]{.underline}</strong>
We've provided several test worlds in which you can experiment, but you
can also develop your own worlds for testing.</p>

<p>When writing your Karel programs, to the maximum extent possible, try to
use the top-down design techniques we developed in class. Break the task
down into smaller pieces until each subtask is something that you know
how to do using the basic Karel commands and control statements. These
Karel problems are somewhat tricky, but appropriate use of top-down
design can greatly simplify them.</p>

<p>As mentioned in class, it is just as important to write clean and
readable code as it is to write correct and functional code. A portion
of your grade on this assignment (and the assignments that follow) will
be based on how well-styled your code is. Before you submit your
assignment, take a minute to review your code to check for stylistic
issues like those mentioned below.</p>

<p><strong>Have you added comments to your functions?</strong> To make your program
easier to read, you can add comments before and inside your functions to
make your intention clearer. Good comments give the reader a clue about
what a function does and, in some cases, how it works. We recommend
writing pre- and post-conditions for each function, as shown in the
table below.</p>

<p><strong>Did you decompose the problem?</strong> There are many ways to break these
Karel problems down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Decomposing
the problem elegantly into smaller sub-problems will result in a small
number of easy-to-read functions, each of which performs just one small
task. Decomposing the problem in other ways may result in functions that
are trickier to understand and test. Look over your code and check to
see whether you've decomposed the problem into smaller pieces. Does
your code consist of a few enormous functions (not so good), or many
smaller functions (good)?</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list of stylistic conventions, but it should
help you get started. As always, if you have any questions on what
constitutes good style, feel free to see the course helpers at the LaIR
with questions, come visit the teaching team during office hours, or
email your section leader with questions!</p>
