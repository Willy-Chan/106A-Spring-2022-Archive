<p>This practice exam is intended to give you practice solving problems that are comparable in difficulty to those which will appear on the final examination.</p>

<h2 id="exam-is-open-book-open-notes">Exam is open book, open notes</h2>
<p>The examination is open-book and you may make use of any handouts, course notes/slides, your programs or other notes you've taken in the class.</p>

<h2 id="taking-the-exam-on-a-computer">Taking the exam on a computer</h2>
<p>You will be taking the exam on a computer using the same Bluebook software that we provided for the midterm exam.  The software we provide basically acts as a simple text editor where you can write your answers.  Notably, while using our software to take the exam you will not be allowed to access the internet nor any files on your computer.  So, please make sure you bring printouts of any reference materials you are going to use on the exam.</p>

<h2 id="coverage">Coverage</h2>
<p>The final exam is comprehensive in that it covers material presented throughout the class.</p>

<h2 id="general-instructions">General instructions</h2>
<p>Answer each of the questions included in the exam.  Make sure to include any work that you wish to be considered for partial credit (even it is not compilable code).</p>

<p>Each question is marked with the number of points assigned to that problem.  The total number of points is 180.  We intend for the number of points to be roughly comparable to the number of minutes you should spend on that problem.</p>

<p>In all questions, you may include functions or definitions that have been developed in the course, either by writing the import line for the appropriate library or by giving the name of the function and the handout or date of the slides in which that function appears.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated as part of the instructions for a specific problem, comments will not be required on the exam.  Uncommented code that gets the job done will be sufficient for full credit on the problem.  On the other hand, comments may help you to get partial credit if they help us determine what you were trying to do.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-lists-20-points">Problem 1 Lists (20 Points)</h3>

<p>The company DataScrambler.com has hired you to write a function called interleave_lists, which has the following header: <strong>def interleave_lists(list1, list2)</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>interleave_lists</strong> function is passed two lists of integers (list1 and list2), and should return a new list of integers that interleaves the elements (numbers) from list1 and list2.  The result of interleaving list1 and list2 is simply a list of integers that contains (in order) alternating elements (numbers) from list1 and list2 (starting with a number from list1).  If one of the lists passed in to the function is longer than the other, then any remaining numbers from the longer list which are not already included in the interleaved list are simply added (in order) to the end of the result.</p>

<p>For the examples we give below, say we have the following three lists:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">]</span> 

<span class="n">second</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">]</span>   

<span class="n">third</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">]</span>  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Calling:   interleave_lists(first, second)</p>

<p>should return this list: [1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30, 4, 40, 5, 6, 7]</p>

<p>Note that the interleaved lists that is returned starts with the value 1 from the list first, then 10 from the list second, then 2 from the list first, then 20 from the list second, and so on.  Since the list first is longer than the list second, after the values 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the list first have been interleaved with the values 10, 20, 30 and 40 from the list second, the remaining elements of the lists first (5, 6, 7) are simply added to the end of the resulting interleaved list.</p>

<p>Here are two additional examples of what should be returned from your interleave_list function: 
Calling: interleave_lists(second, third)</p>

<p>should return this list: [10, 100, 20, 30, 40]</p>

<p>And calling: interleave_lists(third, first)</p>

<p>should return this list: [100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</p>

<p>If one of the lists passed into your function is an ‚Äúempty‚Äù list ([]), you should still perform an interleaving, but the empty list will contribute nothing to the result.  If you are passed two empty lists, your function should return an empty list.</p>

<p>Write your interleave_lists function below.  Note that for this problem you don't need to write a complete program ‚Äì you just need to implement the interleave_lists function.  Feel free to define any additional functions that you would like to help you solve this problem.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">interleave_lists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">list2</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h3 id="problem-2-strings-20-points">Problem 2 Strings (20 Points)</h3>

<p>Computers have gotten very good at correcting our writing mistakes.  One form of such correction is making sure that sentences we write are properly capitalized.  For example, given a string that contains some text, we want to make sure that the first letter of every sentence is capitalized and all other letters are lower case.</p>

<p>For example, consider the string: <strong>'almost done with finals? yah!!!  ** so HAPPY. have a GoOd BrEaK!'</strong></p>

<p>The properly capitalized version of this string would be: <strong>'Almost done with finals? Yah!!!  ** So happy. Have a good break!'</strong></p>

<p>To implement this functionality, your job is to write a function fix_capitalization that takes a string name str as its argument and returns a new string which is the properly capitalized version of the original string passed in.</p>

<p>The rules for proper capitalization are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first letter of the string is capitalized (upper case).</li>
  <li>The first letter after each end-of-sentence punctuation mark should be capitalized. For our purposes, we'll consider period ('.'), exclamation point ('!') and question mark ('?') as the only three characters that can be used as punctuation to end sentences, so you should not consider any other end-of-sentence punctuation.</li>
  <li>All letters that are not capitalized (according to the rules above) should be lower case.</li>
  <li>Characters which are not letters should remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you call:</p>

<p><strong>fix_capitalization("STANFORD ROCKS!!")</strong></p>

<p>your function should return the string: <strong>"Stanford rocks!!"</strong>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if  you call:</p>

<p><strong>fix_capitalization("</strong>*almost done!! <strong>* that's AwESoME?!  yes, IT IS.")</strong></p>

<p>your function should return: <strong>"</strong>*Almost done!! <strong>* That's awesome?!  Yes, it is."</strong></p>

<p>As you can see above, we make the first letter at the beginning of the string or after a punctuation mark upper case even when there are (an arbitrary number of) intervening non-letter characters (such as "<strong><em>almost done!!" and "</em></strong> that's" in the second example above, which are properly capitalized as "<strong><em>Almost done!!" and "</em></strong> That's", respectively, regardless of the intervening non-letter characters).</p>

<p>In writing your solution, you should keep in mind that you do not need to write a complete program.  All you need is the definition of the function fix_capitalization that returns the desired result.  You may write any additional functions that may help you solve this problem, but you are not required to decompose your solution.  Write your solution to this problem on the next page.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-graphics-25-points">Problem 3 Graphics (25 Points)</h3>

<p>To get more artistic with your programming, you decide to write a function called draw_sketch that is passed a graphics canvas and draws a simple line sketch ‚Äúartwork‚Äù on that canvas.  Your function should first asking the user (on the console) for the ‚ÄúNumber of lines in the drawing:‚Äù.  You can assume the user will always enter a positive integer value.  You should then create a drawing on the canvas which is produced by drawing lines with randomly determined starting and ending points, where the ending point of each line in the drawing becomes the starting point for the subsequent line, so all the lines in the drawing are connected.  The starting/ending points for each line can appear anywhere on the canvas, which has size (in pixels) specified by the constants CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT.  Figure 1 below shows an example of an output of this program where the user asked for 5 lines in the drawing.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Practice Final Exam_files/graphics1.png" style="width: 90%"></p>

<p>Note that there is also a colored circle (both the fill and outline of the circle are colored) centered at the end point of each line in the drawing.  This is to add more artistic flair to the drawing.  The colors used for the circles are determined by the constant COLORS, which is a list of color names (strings), as shown below.</p>

<p><code class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">COLORS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'red'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'orange'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'yellow'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'green'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'blue'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'violet'</span><span class="p">]</span></code></p>

<p>The colors for the circles you draw should cycle through the COLORS list, starting with the color red for the starting point of the first line, then the color orange for the starting point of the second line (which is also the ending point of the first line), and so on.  After drawing a circle that is violet, the next circle drawn should be red again, since the colors are being cycled through.  Each colored circle should appear underneath the two lines that are connected at that point in the drawing, though it is fine if the circle appears in front of lines that came earlier in the drawing.  The radius (in pixels) of the circle is determined by the constant RADIUS.</p>

<p>Two additional program runs are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 below, which have 8 and 12 lines, respectively, to show the cycling of colors in the circles.  Note that while the endpoints of all the lines should appear on the graphics canvas, it is fine if the circles drawn get clipped if they are too close to the edge of the canvas.</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Practice Final Exam_files/graphics2.png" style="width: 90%"></p>

<p>Write your function draw_sketch below.  Note that for this problem you can assume that there is a main function that has already created a canvas with the dimensions CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT, and is passing that canvas to your draw_sketch function.  So, you just need to implement the draw_sketch function.  Feel free to define any additional functions that you would like to help you solve this problem.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-file-processing-25-points">Problem 4 File Processing (25 Points)</h3>
<p>You are given a text file containing information about a group of people‚Äôs best friends.  The file is structured so that each line contains the name of a particular person as well as the name of their best friend.  You can assume that people‚Äôs names are unique (e.g., anytime a name like ‚ÄúPat‚Äù appears, it is always referring the same person named ‚ÄúPat‚Äù).  And to keep things simple, you can also assume that each name is just a single token representing the first name of the person.  Also, each person has at most one best friend.  A sample data file might look as follows:</p>

<p><strong>data.txt</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bob Alice
Chelsea Bob
Eduardo Don
Alice Chelsea
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file above indicates that Bob‚Äôs best friend is Alice, Chelsea‚Äôs best friend is Bob, etc.  Note that not everyone is required to have a best friend (for example, Eduardo‚Äôs best friend is Don, but Don doesn‚Äôt have a best friend in the file).  And best friends are not necessarily reciprocal (Bob‚Äôs best friend is Alice, but Alice‚Äôs best friend is not Bob).</p>

<p>You think it would be interesting to determine if there is a ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù in such data.  A ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù occurs when you start at some person, then find their best friend, then find that person‚Äôs best friend, etc. until you get back to the starting person.  For example, the data above contains a ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù since we could start with Bob, then link to Alice (Bob‚Äôs best friend), then link to Chelsea (Alice‚Äôs best friend), and then link back to Bob (Chelsea‚Äôs best friend).</p>

<p>Your job is to write a function contains_loop that is passed the name of a file (string) containing the best friend data and determines if the data contains a ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù.  Your function should return True if the data in the file in contains at least one ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù and False otherwise (i.e., return False when there are no best friend loops).</p>

<p><strong>Hint: consider reading the file into a dictionary (where the key is a person‚Äôs name and the value is the name of that person‚Äôs best friend) and use that dictionary to help you determine if a loop exists.</strong></p>

<p>To provide another example, the file noloops.txt below does not contain any ‚Äúbest friend loops‚Äù, so your function should return False if the filename "noloops.txt" were passed to it.</p>

<p><strong>noloops.txt</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Eric Fran
Fran Helen
Gary Helen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, it is fine for someone to be their own best friend, which would constitute a ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù. This is shown in the file loveyourself.txt below (the ‚Äúbest friend loop‚Äù is simply starting with Pat and then linking back to Pat).  So, your function should return True in this case.</p>

<p><strong>loveyourself.txt</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pat Pat
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">contains_loop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h3 id="problem-5-using-data-structures-30-points">Problem 5 Using Data Structures (30 Points)</h3>
<p>Realizing that the US National Debt is now over $30 trillion, you decide to create the notion of ‚ÄúBig Numbers‚Äù, allowing you to represent (and add) arbritrarily large positive integer values.  You are going to represent such a large number as a list of digits.  For example, the number 16,381,245 could be represented using a list where each entry of the list is a single digit, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Practice Final Exam_files/lists1.png"></p>

<p>To allow you to more easily add such numbers, it would be useful to store the digits of the ‚ÄúBig Number‚Äù backwards, so that the ones digit is always in position 0, the tens digit is always in position 1, the hundreds digit is always in position 2, etc.  So, the list representing 16,381,245 would actually look as follows (with indexes shown below the list):</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Practice Final Exam_files/lists2.png"></p>

<p><u>The list should only have as many elements as the number of digits in the number it represents</u>.  So, if we had a variable (list) named bignum1 representing the number 9,564 and wanted to add to it another variable (list) named bignum2 representing 867, we should (like you did in first grade) add the ones digits (which are respectively both at index 0), then add the tens digits (at index 1), etc. to get the resulting sum 10,431, shown in the variable result below:</p>

<p><img src="./CS106A Practice Final Exam_files/lists3.png"></p>

<p>Note that the resulting sum can have more digits than either of the original numbers added together.</p>

<p>Your job is to implement a function named add_bignums that is passed two ‚ÄúBig Numbers‚Äù (i.e., lists of digits in backwards order, as discussed above) and returns a new list representing the ‚ÄúBig Number‚Äù (i.e. list of digits in backwards order) that represents the sum of the two numbers passed in, using the algorithm described above to add the numbers digit-by-digit, starting at the ones digit).  Your function should not modify the two lists that are passed into it.</p>

<p>For example, say your function is called with lists (as defined above) representing the numbers 9,564 and 867 as ‚ÄúBig Numbers‚Äù, respectively:</p>

<p><strong>add_bignums([4, 6, 5, 9], [7, 6, 8])</strong></p>

<p>then your function should return the list:</p>

<p><code class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span></code></p>

<p>which would represent the value 10,431 as a ‚ÄúBig Number‚Äù (i.e., list of digits in backwards order).</p>

<p>In writing your solution, you should keep in mind that you do not need to write a complete program.  All you need is the definition of the function add_bignums that returns the desired result.  You may write any additional functions that may help you solve this problem, but you are not required to decompose your solution.  Write your solution to this problem on the next page.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="problem-6-full-program-30-points">Problem 6 Full Program (30 Points)</h3>
<p>Interestingly, people tend to see patterns in data, even when the data may be random.  For example, say you are given a file that contains a series of positive integers, one per line.  You want to determine when chains appear.  A chain is a sequence of numbers that consecutively increase by one.  More concretely, say we had the following sequence of 10 numbers:</p>

<p><strong>5, <u>3, 4, 5</u>, 1, <u>4, 5</u>, 3, 6</strong></p>

<p>Here, we would have two "chains" in the data (the chains are underlined in the sequence above).  To reiterate, a chain is just a sequence of consecutive numbers where each subsequent number is greater than the previous number by one.</p>

<p>We want to write a Python that reads a file of integers (the filename will be specified by the constant FILENAME), containing one integer per line and guaranteed to contain at least one number.  The program should print out the length of the longest chain that appears in the file.  For clarification, we show three different data files (data1.txt, data2.txt, and data3.txt) below.  We highlight the ‚Äúchains‚Äù in each file (with red) to show the reason for the final result in each case.  The file will not have this highlighting ‚Äì it just contains the integers.  Your program should just output the length of the longest chain in the file as shown below for each file.  If there are no chains found in the data, your program should report "No chains found."</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-classes-30-points">Problem 7 Classes (30 Points)</h3>
<p>We want to build a class in Python to handle a box office ticket management system that keeps track of tickets sold for shows at the Bing Concert Hall (referred to as just ‚ÄúBing‚Äù here).  For the purposes of this problem, we will assume that Bing has 500 seats that are numbered 1 to 500.  Thus, seats are simply designated by integers from 1 to 500.  We want to design a class, where we can create an object that allows a user to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine if there are still tickets available for sale from the box office.</li>
  <li>Get (purchase) the next available ticket from the box office, if there are tickets available.</li>
  <li>Return a previously purchased ticket to the box office (which would make it available for someone else to potentially get/buy in the future).</li>
</ul>

<p>With this idea in mind, we want to define a class called TicketSystem which has a constructor as well as three methods (‚Äúmethod‚Äù is just another name for a function that is in a class), defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has_tickets() ‚Äì  this method returns True if there are tickets still available for purchase, which means that either there are still unsold seats or there are tickets which have been returned and not yet sold again (or both).  If no tickets are available, the method returns False .</li>
  <li>next_ticket() ‚Äì  if there are tickets available, this method returns an integer indicating the seat designation of the next available ticket.  If no tickets are available, the method returns -1 since there are no valid available seats.</li>
  <li>return_ticket(ticket) ‚Äì  this method is passed a valid (previously purchased) ticket (i.e., integer designating a seat).  This ticket is considered returned to the box office and is once again available for sale (i.e., some future call to next_ticket could return this ticket).  This method does not need to do error checking on the ticket passed in ‚Äì you can assume that the ticket will always be a valid number for a seat that was previously sold.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the box office chooses to sell tickets in a particular order, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If any tickets for seats have been returned, sell those tickets first in the order in which they were returned, before selling any other available seats.</li>
  <li>If there are no previously sold tickets that have been returned to sell again, then sell seats in order by section number (first) and by seat number (second).  So, the first ticket sold would be 1, followed by 2, then 3, etc.  Thus, 500 would be the last ticket to be sold (not counting returned tickets).
As an example, say we sell tickets 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Then, ticket 2 is returned, and then ticket 1 is returned.  The next ticket we will sell will be 2, followed by 1.  After that (assuming no other ticket has been returned), we would then sell ticket 5 next.</li>
</ul>

<p>We give you the outline of the class TicketSystem and the methods specified in the class below.  Your task is to write the implementation (body) of each of the methods in the class TicketSystem.  Write your answer below.  Note that you do not have to write a program that creates objects based on your class.  We just want you to define the methods in the class.</p>
